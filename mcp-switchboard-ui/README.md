## Development

### Quick Start
```sh
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development mode
./dev-restart.sh

# Stop development servers
./dev-shutdown.sh

# Run unit tests
./test-models.sh
```

### Manual Commands
```sh
npm run dev          # Frontend development server
npm run tauri dev    # Full Tauri development mode
npm run build        # Production build
npm run tauri build  # Tauri desktop build
```

### Testing
```sh
./test-models.sh     # Run model management unit tests (background)
tail -f ./test.log   # Monitor test progress
kill $(cat test.pid) # Stop tests if needed
```

### Configuration
- **Development**: Set `TOGETHERAI_API_KEY` environment variable
- **Production**: API key stored encrypted in platform config directory
- **Logging**: Uses tauri-plugin-log with INFO/FINE/FINER levels

## Architecture

**Frontend**: SvelteKit 2.x + Svelte 5.x + TypeScript  
**Backend**: Tauri 2.x + Rust  
**AI API**: Together.ai via async-openai client  
**Security**: AES-256-GCM encrypted config storage  
**Communication**: Event-driven Tauri commands and streaming
